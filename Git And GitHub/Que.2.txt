Que.2- Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository. 
Ans - A Git workflow involves three primary states: the working directory where you make changes 
      to files, the staging area (also called the index) where you prepare specific changes to be 
      committed, and the repository which stores the final, committed versions of your files, essentially 
      acting as a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time; allowing you to track changes and 
      revert to previous versions if needed. 

      Working Directory:
	* This is where you actively edit and modify files on your local machine. 
        * Any changes made here are not yet part of the version control system until staged. 

      Staging Area (Index):
	* Acts as a temporary holding area where you explicitly select which changes from your working 
	  directory you want to include in the next commit. 
        * To add files to the staging area, you use the "git add" command. 

      Repository:
        * This is where the final, committed versions of your files are stored. 
        * To create a snapshot of the staged changes and store them in the repository, you use the "git commit" 
          command, which usually includes a descriptive message explaining what changes were made.
