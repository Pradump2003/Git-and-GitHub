Que.4- Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some
       alternatives to GitHub.
Ans -  GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well
       as track and control changes to their code over time. It also provides a number of features that make it easy for
       teams to collaborate on software projects.

       GitHub facilitates collaboration and version control in the following ways
       * Version Control :-
			    GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to code. This allows
        developers to see who made what changes and when, and to revert to previous versions of the code if
        necessary.

       * Branches:-
		* Create a new branch to isolate changes for a specific feature or fix. 
         * Each branch represents a snapshot of the project at a particular point in time. 
         * Developers can work on their branches independently without affecting the main codebase

       * Pull Requests:- 
		       * When a developer is ready to integrate their branch changes into the main code, they create a pull request. 
         * A pull request includes a description of the changes, allows for code review by other team members, and facilitates 
           discussion before merging. 
         * Once the changes are reviewed and approved, the pull request can be merged into the target branch. 

       * Issues and tasks:- 
			GitHub provides a way for developers to track issues and tasks related to their code. This
         helps teams to stay organized and to prioritize their work.

       * Code reviews:-  
                    GitHub makes it easy for developers to review each other's code. This helps to improve the
          quality of the code and to identify potential bugs.

       Some of the platforms that provide the same functionality similar to GitHub can be -
       1. GitLab
       2. BitBucket
       3. Source Forge
       4. Launchpad
