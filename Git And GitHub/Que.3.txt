Que.3 - Explain what .gitignore is and why itâ€™s important in version control ?
Ans -  A ".gitignore" file is a text file used in Git version control systems to specify 
       which files and directories should be ignored when committing changes to a repository, 
       essentially preventing unnecessary or temporary files from being tracked and cluttering up 
       the project history, making it crucial for maintaining a clean and efficient repository. 

       Importance - 
	* The .gitignore files are important in version control because they help to keep the repository clean and
          organized. They also prevent developers from accidentally committing unnecessary files to the repository,
          such as log files, build artifacts, and IDE configuration files.

	  Here are some examples of files and folders that you might want to ignore in a Git repository: - personal secret
          keys or files, log files, Built artifacts, IDE config files, and temporary files.
